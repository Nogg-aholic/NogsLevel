Changes to main menu level insert to hopefully stop breaking when RefinedRDLib is installed.




## New Stuff

- Changed how the main menu is modified, resulting in it *usually* not breaking when RefinedRDLib is installed.
- Added a warning when RefinedRDLib is installed because it modifies the main menu, sometimes breaking NogsLevel's changes to the main menu.
  - Appears when you click the "new game" button.
  - You can prevent this warning from appearing by turning
    it off in the NogsLevel mod config options.
