Bandaid fix for not being able to place water extractors (Thanks D4rkL0rd!). Note: Refined Power causes a bug with the main menu, has to be fixed on their side.




## Bugfixes

- Fixed that water extractors could not be placed anywhere in the level ("Resource is not deep enough!").
  The error message will still appear, but now it's a soft disqualifier, so it will still let you place it anyways.
- Add additional logging code to try and track down the Refined Power problems with the main menu.
- Fixed typo in Node Copy Count config tooltip
