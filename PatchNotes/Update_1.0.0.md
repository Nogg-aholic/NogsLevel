Modders - U6 introduced significant changes to custom levels.
Be sure to check the repo's
[Modder Readme](https://github.com/Nogg-aholic/NogsLevel/blob/master/ModderReadme.md)
or contact me for more details on how to get your own set up.

## New Stuff

- Update 6 support
- Added a ramp to climb back onto the starting cube with, especially helpful in Water World
- Config option to control how many copies of each resource node spawns (default 1)
- Config option to control if the Resource Plants will be present (default on)
- Config option for if the gas cube exists (default on)
- Debugging command NL_debug
- WIP: control the ambient sounds you will hear while in the level - birds, cicadas, wind, etc. Defaults to none (like the level was in the past)

## Changed Stuff

- Vanilla resource nodes should now spawn in a consistent order
- Slightly raised the spawn height of resource nodes in non-water worlds
- Unknown resource nodes should now use the Iron node mesh as a default if none could be found

## Bugfixes

- Fixed RP_Pure tooltip on solid nodes - they correctly display 'Pure' now
- Fixed that the Bauxite node was invisible and uninteractable
- Fixed that Skip Tutorial didn't also grant Tutorial HUB milestones
- Fixed the water texture again (hopefully this is the last time)
- Fixed U6 crash on the main menu caused by a change in how starting locations are defined
- Fixed U6 crash upon entering the level caused by the new sublevel saving system
- Fixed that using the Unlock Schematics option could crash if another mod defined an invalid schematic

Feedback on the mod in general would be greatly appreciated. The [Discord](http://discord.gg/zqp6U7Y7Nu) is the best place to reach us.
