Update 8 support.



This update brought to you by Robb.
If you enjoy my work, please consider my [completely optional tip jar](https://ko-fi.com/robb4).

## Changed Stuff

- Changed the mod to use the new SML map selection system
  - The mod can no longer be configured as part of the menu map selection process, you have to configure it from the configs screen now
  - Most config options will Eventuallyâ„¢ be migrated to Mod Savegame Settings, which are stored per-save and set as part of the menu map selection process

## Removed Stuff

- No longer produces warnings when RefinedRDLib is installed because the new SML map selection system prevents the mods from interfering with each other
