1.0 support. Migrated config options to Mod Savegame Settings.



This update brought to you by Robb.
If you enjoy my work, please consider my [completely optional tip jar](https://ko-fi.com/robb4).

## Changed Stuff

- All world configuration options are now in Mod Savegame Settings, enabling them to be stored per save file instead of per game install. This makes dedicated servers using the map much easier to configure.
- Replaced obsolete Flower Petals plant with Mycelia

## Removed Stuff

- Removed "Unlock All Schematics", "Skip Onboarding", "NoPower", and "NoCost" config options. Use Advanced Game Settings or another mod instead.
- Removed the ability to specify a session name when using the config screen world opening shortcut.

## Bugfixes

- Fixed that resource plants still had collision when disabled
